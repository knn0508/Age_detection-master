# Render Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### ✅ Code Preparation
- [x] Flask app (`app.py`) is configured for production
- [x] Environment-based path configuration implemented
- [x] Camera availability checks added
- [x] Static files created and linked in templates
- [x] JavaScript for production environment handling added
- [x] Error handling for camera access in production

### ✅ Configuration Files
- [x] `requirements.txt` - All dependencies listed with compatible versions
- [x] `gunicorn.conf.py` - Production server configuration
- [x] `render.yaml` - Render deployment configuration
- [x] Static files in `static/` folder
- [x] Templates updated with static file references

### ✅ Production Optimizations
- [x] Single worker configuration (for model consistency)
- [x] Persistent disk configuration for face data storage
- [x] CPU-only model initialization
- [x] Memory-efficient settings
- [x] Production environment detection

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create Render Web Service
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select "Web Service"
4. Choose your repository
5. Select branch: `main`
6. Render will auto-detect the `render.yaml` configuration

### 3. Environment Variables (Auto-configured)
- `ENVIRONMENT=production` ✅
- `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.9` ✅
- `WEB_CONCURRENCY=1` ✅

### 4. Service Configuration (Auto-configured)
- **Build Command**: `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt` ✅
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn --config gunicorn.conf.py app:app` ✅
- **Region**: Oregon (Free tier) ✅
- **Plan**: Free ✅

### 5. Persistent Storage
- **Disk Name**: `age-prediction-disk` ✅
- **Mount Path**: `/opt/render/project/src/data` ✅
- **Size**: 1GB ✅

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Application Health
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Home page loads successfully
- [ ] Image upload functionality works
- [ ] Face detection and age prediction working
- [ ] Learned faces are saved and persist
- [ ] Camera features show appropriate messages

### ✅ Features Testing
- [ ] Upload image via capture mode ✅
- [ ] Age detection results displayed ✅
- [ ] Face learning and recognition working ✅
- [ ] Learned faces page shows saved data ✅
- [ ] Real-time mode shows production notice ❌ (Expected - no camera)

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] Response times acceptable (< 10s for image processing)
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] No frequent crashes or restarts
- [ ] Logs show normal operation

## Expected Limitations in Production

### ❌ Disabled Features (Expected)
- Real-time video streaming (no camera access)
- Webcam capture functionality
- Live video feed

### ✅ Working Features
- Image upload and processing
- Age detection from uploaded images
- Face learning and recognition
- Persistent storage of learned faces
- Web interface and navigation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Deployment fails during build**
   - Check `requirements.txt` for incompatible versions
   - Verify Python version compatibility
   - Check build logs for specific errors

2. **Application crashes on startup**
   - Check if model initialization succeeds
   - Verify memory usage is within limits
   - Check for missing dependencies

3. **Image processing fails**
   - Verify InsightFace model loads correctly
   - Check CPU mode is configured
   - Monitor memory usage during processing

4. **Persistent storage issues**
   - Verify disk mount is working
   - Check file permissions
   - Monitor disk usage

### Monitoring Commands

Check application logs:
```bash
# Via Render dashboard
# Logs tab in your service
```

Check service status:
```bash
# Via Render dashboard
# Service overview tab
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Deployment Successful When:**
- Application deploys without errors
- Home page accessible
- Image upload works correctly
- Age detection produces results
- Face learning saves data persistently
- No critical errors in logs
- Appropriate messages for disabled camera features

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Monitor Performance**
   - Watch memory usage
   - Check response times
   - Monitor error rates

2. **User Testing**
   - Test image upload workflow
   - Verify face detection accuracy
   - Check learned faces functionality

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README with live URL
   - Document any deployment-specific notes
   - Create user guide if needed

## Deployment URL
After successful deployment, your app will be available at:
`https://[service-name].onrender.com`

Replace `[service-name]` with the name you choose for your Render service.
